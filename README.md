# Triple Dojo

Hi ninjas,

Before attend triple dojo you need to install:
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
* [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation)
* [Node.js](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation) better with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
* Git

to run use:
````bash
    devlab start
````

to test use:
````bash
    devlab test
````

## note
Finally the people resolve the kata by code optimization instead adding the new service.
To view the intended idea look at: dojo-kake-resolved-directors-cut
